# Airborne particles are solids suspended in the air.

# Larger particles - larger then 100 μm

# settles out slowly
# includes fine ice crystals, pollen, hair, large bacteria, windblown dust, fly ash, coal dust, silt, fine sand, and small dust

# Small particles - less than 1 μm
# falls slowly, take days to years to settle out of a quiet atmosphere. In a turbulent atmosphere they may never settle out
# can be washed out by water or rain

# The micrometre (International spelling as used by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures;
# SI symbol: μm) or micrometer (American spelling), also commonly known as a micron, 
# is an SI derived unit of length equaling 1×10−6 metre (SI standard prefix "micro-" = 10−6); 
# that is, one millionth of a metre (or one thousandth of a millimetre, 0.001 mm, or about 0.000039 inch).

###### Particle Size Discrimination by PPD42NJ (January 29th, 2013)
# https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/160/original/Size_Discrimination%28PPD42NJ%29.pdf
#
# Discrimination of particle size can be done using a special method with our Particle Sensor, Model
# PPD42NJ.
#
# PPD42NJ has dual pulse output which works as follows;
# 1) Receptor receives scattered light from the particle, as a pulse.
# 2) Each raw pulse is amplified by an op-amp so that pulse can be acknowledged clearly.
# 3) PPD42NJ has 2 fixed threshold; voltage = 1V for P1 and voltage = 2.5V for P2.
# The threshold represents detecting size of particles, (approx) 1 micron or larger, and (approx.) 2.5
# micron or larger sized particles respectively.
# 
# With PPD42NJ you can read each selected pulse, selected with 2 threshold detection voltage 1V and
# 2.5V which was converted to Lo Pulse directly at the same time.
#
# PPD42NJ also has a port enabling the user to set the alternative threshold detection voltage directly.
# (In other words, a threshold detection voltage 2.5V will be replaced with your designated alternative
# voltage.)

# As you may understand from above 3), you can have 2 different minimum size particles which will
# generate a pulse.
#
# For example:
# Particle sizes of cigarette smoke range from 0.01 micron to around 1micron.
# Particle sizes of house dust range from 1 micron to around 10 micron.
# 
# When you use 1V threshold (when you read Lo Pulse output at P1,) PPD42NJ detects particles
# larger than (approx.) 1 micron.
# 
# When you use 2.5V threshold (when you read Lo Pulse output at P2,) PPD42NJ detects partic#les
# larger than (apporx.) 2.5 micron.
#
# Over 1 micron sized particles represents cigarette smoke and house dust.
#
# Over 2.5 micron sized particles represents house dust only, because this is over the size range of
# cigarette smoke particles
#
# When you use our PPD42NJ to check unidentified particles in the room, you check the Lo Pulse
# occupancy time (ratio) over a certain unit time at both P1 and P2.
#
# By simple math you can then determine how much of which range of particle sizes there are.
#
# Pattern A
# 1V threshold Lo pulse output occupancy ratio : high
# 2.5V threshold Lo pulse output occupancy ratio : low or none
# means you have cigarette smoke at that period.
#
# Pattern B
# 1V threshold Lo pulse output occupancy ratio : high -- (a)
# 2.5V threshold Lo pulse output occupancy ratio : high --(b)
# (a) - k*(b) nearly equal 0(zero)
# means you have house dust at that period
#
# Pattern C
# 1V threshold Lo pulse output occupancy ratio : high -- (a)
# 2.5V threshold Lo pulse output occupancy ratio : high --(b)
# (a) - k*(b) still rather high
# means you have cigarette smoke and house dust at the same time at that period
